# ExpressjsRestApi

Hi Guys Here I created basic Express js Rest api with create,edit,update,list,listview and delete operation.
You can Create a database with table having columns like the variables used in insert query(id,email,phoneno,address,gender).
Change the connection string to your db crdential and db name. you can run it.
